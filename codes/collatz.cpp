MADE BY ADITYA
Programming Language: C++

Enter your input on seperate lines in the following form:

Starting seed    (an integral value)
hide             (optional, type "hide" to hide the graph if output is messy, else no need to enter anything on this line)







- Best viewed on large screens

- The values in graph have been rounded to the nearest 0.1 units

- It may say "No output" for very large seeds.

- If you run this code on your own compiler, make sure you give some random string (if not "hide") as input on second line, or you won't get any output





Collatz Conjecture states that if we take a positive integer and apply two simple rules: if its even, half it,
and if its odd multiply it by three and add one; we will always end up with a loop of 4,2,1
Note that its only a conjecture and has not been proven

This conjecture has many other names like Ulam conjecture, Kakutan's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasses' algorithm,
Syracuse problem, and 3n+1 conjecture
